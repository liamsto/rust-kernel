# A work in progress OS written in Rust
This is a work in progress OS written in Rust. The goal is to create a simple OS that can run on a real machine. The OS will be written in Rust and is mainly for educational purposes.

The basis of the OS will follow the [amazing tutorial](https://os.phil-opp.com/) by Phillip Oppermann. From there I have many plans to add on some interesting features.
